\section{Results}

\subsection{Magnetic field in function of the width of the coil}

The magnetic field of 23 measurements at th maximum voltage was recorded. The 
results of these measurements are displayed in figure \ref{BvasteV}. The 
magnetic field is rendered in function of the width of the coil. Although we 
expected there to be an optimal coilwidth, there is absolutely no correlation 
between the field strength and the dimensions of the generating coil. We 
presume more measurements have to be performed under more strict conditions to 
determine any relation.

\subsection{Magnetic field in function of the bank voltage}

The same 23 measurements are displayed in figure \ref{BvasteD}. This time, the 
magnetic field is rendered in function of the voltage of the capacitor.  
Although no real relationship can be determined, it is clear that a higher 
voltage usually results in a stronger field.
