\section{Generation of magnetic fields}

Magnetic fields are of the utmost importance to the experimental physicist.  
They are mostly used in conjunction with cryostats to research the properties 
of various solids. For this reason, various techniques have been invented to 
generate strong magnetic fields. There are basically three classes of 
techniques: continuous, pulsed non-destructive and pulsed destructive field 
generation methods. Various techniques have been summed up in table 
\ref{methodTable} together with their strongest produced fields 
\cite{highPulsedMagnet} \cite{recordField}.

\begin{table}
\caption{Various magnetic field generation methods}
\label{methodTable}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
Method & Field (T) \\
\hline
\hline
Permanent magnet & 1.25\\
Resistive electromagnet & 36.2\\
Hybrid electromagnet & 45\\
Explosive & 2800 \\

Iron core electromagnets can only be used for fields without saturating up to 
2.16 Tesla \cite{ironSaturation}. For this reason, most coils are used without 
a core.
