We examine a method to generate high pulsed magnetic fields, the single turn 
coil method. It is a destructive method, giving rise to pulsed magnetic fields 
in a timeperiod of about 100 $\mu$s. It is unique amongst the destructive 
methods in that there is no destruction in the sample space. For our 
experiments, we used a portable testing apparatus, powered by a capacitor of 
400\,$\mu$F at 850\,V. The effects of the geometry of the coil and the 
materials of which it is composed were examined. Using the apparatus, it is 
possible to reliably produce magnetic fields with a peak strength of more than 
2 tesla, which is considerable given the size and simplicity of the apparatus.
