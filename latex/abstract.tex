We examine a method to generate high pulsed magnetic fields, the single 
turn coil method. This is a destructive method, giving rise to pulsed 
magnetic fields in a timeperiod of about 100 $\mu$s. It is unique amongst 
the destructive methods in that there is no destruction in the actual 
sample space. For our experiments, we used a small, portable testing 
apparatus, powered by a capacitor of 400\,$\mu$F at 850\,V, capabale of 
producing fields in excess of 2\,T.  We modified the apparatus by adding 
current en coil voltage sensing probes.  The effects of the geometry of the 
coil and the materials of which it is composed on the peak field were 
examined.  The added measurement capabilities also allowed us to examine a 
variety of effects such as the coil inductance, coil deformation, plasma 
conduction and power dissipation in coil and plasma.
