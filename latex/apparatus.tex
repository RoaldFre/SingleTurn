\section{Apparatus}
The apparatus is sketched in figure \ref{circuit}. It consists of a power 
supply that charges a large capacitor (top).  The energy in this capacitor 
gets dumped in the single turn coil (right) through a spring loaded, high 
current switch (left). The coil is mounted over the testsample.

\subsection{Power supply}
The apparatus has a built-in 12\,V 1.2\,Ah sealed lead acid battery to provide 
a portable power supply to charge the capacitor. Because of the age of the 
apparatus, however, the battery had gone dead and the power was provided by a 
12V lab power supply. An inverter boosts the 12V to around 870V to charge the 
high voltage capacitor.

\subsection{Capacitor}
The capacitor used is a 850\,V 400\,$\mu$F bipolar capacitor that can store 
around 150\,J of energy.

\subsection{Switch}
Because of the very high current surges, it is unfeasible to use a standard 
switch to commute this current. Instead, a custom made spring loaded switch is 
used.

This switch consists of two copper bars, separated by a small distance.  
Suspended above these bars, there is a copper disk, which is mounted on a 
notched, spring loaded shaft. The notch slides over a small retaining screw.  
The switch is armed by pulling the shaft out and twisting it, so the screw is 
no longer aligned with the notch.

When the knob is then turned again, the notch lines up with the retaining 
screw and the spring pushes the shaft down. The copper disk is propelled 
towards the copper bars and upon impact the current can flow.

\subsection{Coil}

The apparatus is equipped with a (conducting) vice in which a variety of coils 
can be mounted. These coils are usually made of thin metal foil or sheeting.  
Most of our tests are conducted with coils of 0.5\,mm thick copper foil. An 
hourglass shape is cut from the sheet and bent into the required shape. The 
feeder plates of the coil preferably have a large surface area for the high 
current to pass through. To ensure good conduction, the plates should also be 
sufficiently smooth and parallel. To prepare for a measurement, the coil is 
pressed firmly in the vic, with a piece of Kapton inserted between the plates 
to electrically insulate them and protect the sample space from any stray 
fragments or vapour. Optionally, a small plastic clamp is used to keep the coil 
together. This is sometimes necessary because of the high Maxwell stress that 
is exerted on the material. We experienced that coils made from weaker 
materials, like aluminium foil, can get ripped apart by the magnetic forces 
before a considerable field has formed. Finally, a protective plastic casing is 
installed to protect ourselves and the instruments from flying debris.

\subsection{Sample}
In our case, the sample merely consisted of a small pick up coil to 
determine the generated magnetic field. This pick up coil is a 10 turn coil 
with a diameter of about 4\,mm and a calibrated equivalent surface area of 
136\,mm$^2$.
